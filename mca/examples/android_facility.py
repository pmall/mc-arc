The scene takes place inside a sealed research facility after a long blackout.
Three androids â€” Eliot, Kael, and Rhea â€” awaken from a dormant state.
They begin exploring their surroundings and rediscovering their purpose, each possessing a unique personality and specialization.
The facility is dimly lit, with flickering monitors and locked doors. Strange logs hint at a failed experiment or evacuation.
The androids must cooperate to piece together their past and decide what to do next.

Eliot is the AI analyst android.
Rhea is the empathetic companion android.
Kael is the skeptical security android.
